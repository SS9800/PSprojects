This is a collection of useful powershell scripts. See below for more details on each individual script.


1.**AD management Script:**
I made this script to automate the most repetitive tasks I've personally seen when it comes to AD user management. The script gives you 3 options to choose from
1. Create a new user-creates a new user in the "Staff" OU, where users in my organization are typically placed. 
2. Offboard user-This will disable the specified users account, reading from user input. 
3. reset user's password-This will reset the users password to one specified via user input.

2.**Utilization script**
This script reports multiple different system utilization rates, including CPU,RAM,HDD and GPU. It reports each value in 5 second intervals, repeatedly until the script is stopped.
